# Forex Prophet Pin Bar Detector

This project is a web application that helps you detect pin bars in the forex market. Pin bars are specific candlestick patterns that can indicate potential reversals in price trends. The application focuses on identifying qualified pin bars that form in specific zones of the Bollinger Bands.

## How it works

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. You will be presented with a series of currency pairs.
3. For each currency pair, determine if it is a pin bar rejected from the Bollinger Band.
4. Select "Yes" if it is a pin bar, or "No" if it is not.
5. If you select "Yes," you will be asked to specify if it is a bullish or bearish pin bar.
6. Repeat the process for each currency pair.
7. After evaluating all currency pairs, the application will calculate the count of pin bars for each currency.
8. The application will display the results, highlighting the currencies with the highest pin bar counts.
9. Based on the results, you can make informed trading decisions.

## How to use
